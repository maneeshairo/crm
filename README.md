 Simple Codeigniter CRM
====================

 Simple CRM is a basic open source web application for storing problem
reports and tracking requests. 

Installation
------------

 Simple CRM is written in PHP using the CodeIgniter framework. You
should find it easy to install provided you have access to a webserver and a
database.

The code generally expects to be running under an Apache webserver with a
mySQL database. It may be possible change these things if your system
is different -- see the installation documentation:
